    "1) What is the value of the coefficient for predictor RM?\n",
    "\n",
    "**8.4016**\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Are the predictors for this model statistically significant?\n",
    "\n",
    " **Both \"rm\" and \"age\" predictors are statistically significant in this model, as their p-values are less than the typical significance level of 0.05.**\n",
    "\n",
    "3) What most likely happened to our R-Squared value when we added the third predictor LSTAT to our initial model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**When you added the third predictor, LSTAT, to the initial model, the R-squared value increased from 0.530 to 0.639. An increase in R-squared generally indicates that the added predictor (LSTAT, in this case) contributes to explaining additional variance in the dependent variable (medv).**\n",
    "\n",
    "4) What type of model should we use when our target outcome, or dependent variable, is continuous?\n",
    "\n",
    "**When our target outcome or dependent variable is continuous, linear regression is a common and appropriate modeling technique. Linear regression models the relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Which predictors have the largest coefficient?\n",
    "\n",
    "**n the provided output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intercept: The coefficient for the intercept is -1.1753. **\n",
    "\n",
    "**rm (Number of rooms): The coefficient is 5.0191.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**age (Age of the property): The coefficient is 0.0091.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**lstat (Percentage of lower status of the population): The coefficient is -0.6685.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The predictor with the largest coefficient is \"rm\" (Number of rooms), with a coefficient of 5.0191. This means that, in this model, a one-unit increase in the number of rooms is associated with an approximate 5.0191-unit increase in the dependent variable (medv), assuming other predictors are held constant.**\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Which values for DMDEDUC2x and RIAGENDRx are represented in out intercept, or what is our  reference level?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The intercept (3.3292) represents the estimated mean value of DMDEDUC2 when all other variables (in this case, only RIAGENDR) are zero. However, since RIAGENDR is a binary variable (1 or 2), the interpretation of the intercept in this context may not be meaningful.**\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Which model should we use when our target outcome, dependent variable is binary, or only has 2 outputs, 0 and 1? \n",
    "\n",
    "**When we target outcome, the dependent variable, is binary with only two possible outcomes (0 and 1), we should use a binary classification model. Binary classification is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict the class label of a given instance, and there are only two possible classes**\n"
