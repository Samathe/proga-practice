The mean score was 62.5, and the standard deviation of the scores was 10. What is a 95% confidence interval for the overall undergraduate mean at the university? (0.3p)\n",

    "4. A new experimental drug for reducing the pain due to migraine headaches is being tested in a randomized controlled trial. A total of 100 participants with a history of migraine headaches are given the drug, and 100 participants with the same history are given a placebo pill. Each participant is asked about their pain one hour after taking the medication, and whether it has been reduced (yes or no). A biostatistician computes an exact 95% confidence interval for the difference in the proportions of people experiencing pain relief within one hour (treatment minus control). The 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions is (-0.05, 0.09). What should the biostatistician conclude? (0.5p)"
