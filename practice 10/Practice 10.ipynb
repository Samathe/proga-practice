    "4. A new experimental drug for reducing the pain due to migraine headaches is being tested in a randomized controlled trial. A total of 100 participants with a history of migraine headaches are given the drug, and 100 participants with the same history are given a placebo pill. Each participant is asked about their pain one hour after taking the medication, and whether it has been reduced (yes or no). A biostatistician computes an exact 95% confidence interval for the difference in the proportions of people experiencing pain relief within one hour (treatment minus control). The 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions is (-0.05, 0.09). What should the biostatistician conclude? (0.5p)"

    "Let's go through each problem step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given data:\n",
    "- Sample size (n) = 500\n",
    "- Sample mean ($(\\bar{x}$)) = 62.5\n",
    "- Sample standard deviation (s) = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to find a 95% confidence interval for the overall undergraduate mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the confidence interval for the mean ($(\\mu$)) is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\bar{x} \\pm \\left( \\frac{t \\cdot s}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right) $\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\(t\\) is the critical t-value for the desired confidence level and degrees of freedom.\n",
    "- \\(s\\) is the sample standard deviation.\n",
    "- \\(n\\) is the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to find the critical t-value for a 95% confidence interval with \\(df = n - 1 = 500 - 1 = 499\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a t-table or a statistical software package to find this value. For a 95% confidence interval and \\(df = 499\\), the critical t-value is approximately 1.96.\n",
    "\n",
    "Substitute these values into the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ 62.5 \\pm \\left( \\frac{1.96 \\cdot 10}{\\sqrt{500}} \\right) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Now calculate the margin of error and construct the interval:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ 62.5 \\pm \\left( \\frac{1.96 \\cdot 10}{\\sqrt{500}} \\right) $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ 62.5 \\pm \\left( \\frac{1.96 \\cdot 10}{\\sqrt{500}} \\right) \\approx 62.5 \\pm 1.384 $\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the 95% confidence interval for the overall undergraduate mean is approximately (61.116, 63.884).\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we are 95% confident that the true mean score of all undergraduates at the university lies between 61.116 and 63.884.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We perform a two-tailed, one-sample t-test with the following information:\n",
    "- Test statistic (t) = -1.12\n",
    "- Degrees of freedom (df) = 499\n",
    "- p-value = 0.264\n",

    "Decision: \n",
    "- Since the p-value (0.264) is greater than the significance level (alpha = 0.05), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given confidence interval for the difference in proportions: (-0.05, 0.09)\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "- Since the confidence interval includes zero, there is no significant evidence to conclude that there is a difference in pain relief between the treatment and control groups. In other words, the experimental drug does not seem to have a statistically significant effect in reducing pain compared to the placebo.\n",
